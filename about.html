   <h6>My practice is the reparation of every thing that has been lost, even if it’s just your keys. It’s an ode to unpracticality and attachment, choosing the most obtuse way to come to a destination. The effort to repair is sincere, and surpasses necessity. Every lost object, forgotten technique, or empty building deserves attention. That is why I like to look at my work as building altars, because I treat them as a possible deity. I often return to cultural phenomena that interest me, such as Croatian traditional singing, Dutch clogs or Orthodox writings. I have a natural tendency to hoard, and often works spring forth from these collections. Material is my main focus, and I relate a lot to craftsmen, although I jump through different techniques; weaving, leatherwork, lace and embroidery amongst others. <br> <br> <em>You can contact me on my email: </em><a href="mailto:nikola.woudstra@gmail.com">nikola.woudstra@gmail.com</a>,<br> <em>or on my instagram: </em> <a href="https://instagram.com/nikolawoudstra">@nikolawoudstra</a></h6>
